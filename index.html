        <h1>Hello world! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
        <p>
            Itâ€™s so nice to meet you! Weâ€™re Interchain GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the <a href="http://interchain.io">Interchain Foundation</a>. As maintainers of the <a href="http://github.com/tendermint/tendermint">Tendermint</a> project, lead architects of the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ics">Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) Protocol</a>, and contributors to the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk">Cosmos SDK</a>, we envision a more connected, open, and self-sovereign world made possible through the <a href="https://comsos.network">Cosmos Network</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We were formerly employees of All In Bits (d.b.a Tendermint Inc), but weâ€™ve branched out as Interchain GmbH in order to create a space where, as engineers and protocol architects, we can focus on core technologies. Weâ€™ll continue to collaborate with our friends and colleagues at All In Bits and elsewhere in the Cosmos ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Onwards and upwards! ðŸš€
        </p>
